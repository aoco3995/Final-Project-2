# Jake Whited - Individual Code Contributions

This folder contains copies of selected code modules that were specifically worked on by **Jake Whited** as part of the individual contribution for the final project.

> **Important:** These scripts are not intended to be run from within this folder. Instead, navigate to the main `Code/` directory and execute all scripts from there to ensure proper handling of file paths and access to all dependencies.

## Included Modules

* `Initial_Train.py` – Contains the baseline code for importing the dataset information and passing it through the dataset class.
* `train_model_with_only_logging.py` – Contains all the methods for logging metrics and generating images and plots from the data. The rest of the training code has been removed and will not work if run.
* `Unlabeled_test_MARS.py` – Generates the pseudo-labels CSV for the unlabeled set and runs the manual grading function.
