“Aircraft _Fuselage_DET2023: An Aircraft Fuselage Defect Detection Dataset”, which is a newly built dataset for developing defect detection models for advanced industrial defect detection systems. 

This folder consists of four files:

1. The coco aircraft fuselage data set is named as aircraft_fuselage_coco folder. There are 389 images in the image folder and .json format label corresponding to images in the annotations folder.
2. The voc aircraft fuselage data set is named as aircraft_fuselage_voc folder. There are 389 images in the JPEGImages folder and .xml format label corresponding to images in the Annotations folder.
3. The yolo aircraft fuselage data set is named as aircraft_fuselage_yolo folder. There are 389 images in the images folder and .txt format label corresponding to images in the labels folder.
4. The unlabeled aircraft fuselage data set is named as unlabel_aircraft_fuselage folder. There are 5212 unlabeled images.



Total images: Dataset contains 5601 images in .jpg format. There are 389 labeled images, and 5212 unlabeled images.

Annotation: 389 images are precisely annotated, 5212 images are unlabeled data.

Tasks: It can be used for training as well as testing the defect detection algorithm.
